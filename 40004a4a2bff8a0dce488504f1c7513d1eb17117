      "message": "I think the reason the inline attribute got swapped was for the android_get_application_target_sdk_version logic. Inlining __fortify_fatal shouldn\u0027t be a problem since it\u0027ll be fatal anyway. At least I think that was the logic the last time I wrote this change. TBH you\u0027d probably need to objdump the pthread_mutex_lock function and have a look at what the compiler is doing with and without this change.",
